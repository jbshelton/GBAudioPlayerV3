# Approximate Timeline
I've been working on and perfecting my audio player for over a year now\! I think I should have a documentation of my journey somewhere\.
- July 2020: I first introduce my idea of a high quality audio player to the world in [this video](https://youtu.be/IegCXD3F1YM) I made\. I hadn't even started to program in assembly yet, so I didn't totally know what I was talking about\.
- September\-October 2020: I get a basic audio player working, which used just the pulse channels\. At the time I couldn't figure out how to get a PCM amplitude of zero without muting the channel, so it only had 14 distinct amplitudes instead of 16\.
- October\-November 2020: I get the first version of my HQ audio player working\. It only has 58 amplitudes and 6\-bit accuracy due to my channel DAC relative values being incorrect, and because I treated the DACs like they only had 14 amplitudes\.
- December 2020: I put my first iteration of GBAudioPlayer on Github\. It was written in Java, was a command line interface, was very slow, and only worked on the Gameboy Color due to my horribly unoptimized code and what I thought was a bug that caused HQ audio to be incredibly distorted when played back on a DMG, but fine when played on a GBC\.
- February 2021: I put my second iteration of GBAudioPlayer, GBAudioPlayerV2, on Github\. Still written with Java, but with the addition of a front\-end written in Python\. I managed to optimize my assembly enough to get stereo HQ audio to play at 43,690Hz on GBC, and a few days after the initial release, I managed to fix playback on DMG\.
- March\-April 2021: I begin prototyping my idea for the SHQ playback method\. Since I was still using bad math, it only had 128 amplitudes with something like 8\-bit accuracy \(unsure because I did not document this super well\.\)
- April 2021: I fix the bad math I was using to calculate all the amplitudes for the HQ audio player, as well as find out how to use all 16 amplitudes of the pulse channels\. This brings the amplitude count from 58 to 104\!
- July\(?\) 2021: I start porting GBAudioPlayerV2 to C, hoping to improve the encoding speed and just to learn C\.
- April\-September 2021: I do some various incremental optimizations and improvements to both my encoder and assembly code\.
- September 2021: I develop a huge breakthrough in my HQ and SHQ playback methods which significantly reduces the amount of noise when playing back audio, which makes playing audio back on DMG sound almost equal to GBC\!
- November 2021: I finally release GBAudioPlayerV3, this program\! However, I failed to notice that I had added a few things that I didn't test that caused the program not to work, so I created a patch which fixed that, as well as added automatic sample rate and timer divider calculation for preset ROM sizes so that no external calculations are required\!
